## PaymentInstrumentType

Indicates the card source for the payment. If not present in the payment defaults to "Card". Available values:

- "Card" where the card source is defined by `EntryMode` and present in either `SensitiveCardData` or `PaymentToken`. If neither are present, then payment (card or mobile) is only accepted by the POI Terminal
- "Check" where the transaction is simply recorded
- "Cash" where the transaction is either recorded, or processed if the POI terminal has cash handling capabilities
- "Mobile" to restrict payment to Mobile only. For example, QR Code payment

## PaymentToken

An object representing a payment token. Consists of three fields: 

Attribute | Requ.  | Format | Description |
-----------------                        | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
[TokenRequestedType](#data-dictionary-tokenrequestedtype)| âœ” | String | Mirrored from the request

## ProductLabel

Product name of a [SaleItem](#data-dictionary-saleitem).

The `ProductLabel` should contain a short, human readable, descriptive name of the product. 

For example, `ProductLabel` could contain the product name typically printed on the customer receipt. 


## Quantity

Item unit quantity


## ResponseRequiredFlag

Boolean. 

True if the Sale System needs to respond to this `DisplayRequest` with a `DisplayResponse`. 

False if the Sale System does not need to send a `DisplayResponse`.


## Result

Indicates the result of the response. Available values: 

Label                | Description       
-------------------- | ----------------- 
Success              | Processing OK. Information related to the result of the processing is contained in other parts of the response message.
Failure              | Processing of the request fails for various reasons. Some further processing according to the type of requested service, the context of the process, and some additional precision about the failure notified in the ErrorCondition data element.
Partial              | The transaction has been processed successfully, but the success is not complete (e.g. only a partial amount is available for the payment, the format to be displayed is not supported and was replaced by a default format).


## ReversalReason

Reason for reversing a successful payment. 

Available values:

- "CustCancel"
- "MerchantCancel"
- "Malfunction"
- "Unable2Compl",
- "SignatureDeclined",
- "Unknown"

## SaleCapabilities

Advises the POI System of the Sale System capabilities and willingness to receive/send event messages. 

`SaleCapabilities` is an array of values containing a combination of the following:

* **CashierStatus**: POI Terminal changes of state are reported back to the Sale System. e.g.
  * "Waiting for Card Presentment"
  * "PIN Entry"
  * "Waiting for Host Authorisation"
  * "Signature Validation"
* **CashierError**: POI Terminal errors are reported back to the Sale System. e.g.
  * "Out of paper"
  * "Printer Error"
  * "Card Swipe Error"
* **CashierInput**: Allows the cashier to provide input from the Sale System. e.g.
  * "Signature OK?"
* **CustomerAssistance**: Allows the cashier to provide assistance to card holders by providing input at specific screens but card holders can still select on terminal. e.g.
  * "Account Selection (Cheque, Savings or Credit).
* **PrinterReceipt**: Redirects receipts to the Sale System instead of the POI Terminal.

## SaleID

Uniquely identifies the Sale System. This value is provided by DataMesh.


## SaleItem 

The `SaleItem` array defines the basket attached to this transaction. Each item is an object which defines a group of similar products in the basket.

The sum of the sale items could be more than <code>RequestedAmount</code> in case of split payment without split of the items (split basket).

### Sale items with a UPC/EAN/ISBN

> Example `SaleItem` with UPC

```json
"SaleItem":[
  {
    "ItemID":0,
    "ProductCode":"5000112576009",
    "EanUpc":"5000112576009",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
    "UnitPrice":"1.95",
    "ItemAmount":"1.95",
    "ProductLabel":"Coca-Cola No Sugar 1.25L"
  }
]
```

* Items which have a UPC/EAN/ISBN must include the UPC/EAN/ISBN in the [EanUpc](#data-dictionary-eanupc) field. 
* Both [ProductCode](#data-dictionary-productcode) and [EanUpc](#data-dictionary-eanupc) should be populated, even if they are the same value
* Other standard mandatory fields in sale item are still mandatory.

### Sale items with modifiers 

> Example `SaleItem` with modifiers

```json
"SaleItem":[
  {
    "ItemID":0,
    "ProductCode":"XXVH776",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
    "UnitPrice":"15.00",
    "ItemAmount":"15.00",
    "ProductLabel":"Big Kahuna Burger"
  },
  {
    "ItemID":1,
	"ParentItemID": 0,
    "ProductCode":"XXVH776-0",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
	"UnitPrice":"0",
    "ItemAmount":"0",
    "ProductLabel":"Extra pineapple"
  },  
  {
    "ItemID":2,
	"ParentItemID": 0,
    "ProductCode":"XXVH776-1",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
	"UnitPrice":"5",
    "ItemAmount":"5",
    "ProductLabel":"Side of fries"
  },
  {
    "ItemID":3,
    "ProductCode":"XXYU998",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
    "UnitPrice":"5.00",
    "ItemAmount":"5.00",
    "ProductLabel":"Tasty Beverage"
  },  
]
```

A sale system may represent sale items in the basket as a hierarchy of sale items and sub items, typically referred to as 'modifiers', or 'substitutions'. 

Examples of products with modifiers: 

* a "Big Kahuna Burger" could contain "Extra pineapple" or "Side of fries" as modifiers.
* a "Sirloin steak" could contain "Pepper sauce" or "Medium rare" as modifiers.
* a "Cappuccino" could contain "Sugar" or "Large" as modifiers.


If the Sale System basket contains sale items and modifiers: 

* Include both sale items and modifiers as `SaleItem` objects in the `SaleItem` array.
* For each modifier, set the `ParentItemID` field to the value of the parent sale item `ItemID`
* Set the `ItemAmount` to the value of the modifier, or set to zero if no value 
* The total amount of an item will be the sum of `ItemAmount` in the sale item, and all associated modifiers
* Modifiers may contain a unique `ProductCode` or share the same `ProductCode` as the parent sale item


Some sale Sale Systems do not record modifiers as individual items. For example, they are stored in a 'notes' or 'cooking instructions' field. In this case the additional notes should be included in the [AdditionalProductInfo](#data-dictionary-additionalproductinfo) field. 


### Item bundles

A Sale System may sell items which are bundled together. 

Examples of item "bundles":

* a "lunch special", containing a main, a dessert, and a drink
* a "Valentines day" bundle, containing flowers, and chocolates 
* a "mixed wine case", containing a selection of different wines 
* a "burger meal", containing burger, chips and a drink

The Sale System should populate the `SaleItem` array based on how the "bundle" is represented in the basket. 

If the "bundle" is represented as a unique product with a title and a price, include the "bundle" product as a `SaleItem`. Contents of the bundle can then be included either as "modifiers" associated with the bundle, or as a text description in the [AdditionalProductInfo](#data-dictionary-additionalproductinfo) field. 

If the "bundle" is a shortcut in the Sale System which has no value associated and is simply used to add multiple products to the basket, include each product as a `SaleItem`.

Any `SaleItem` discounts associated with the "item bundle" should be included in the `Discount` field.


### Discounts 

```json
"SaleItem":[
  {
    "ItemID":0,
    "ProductCode":"XXVH776",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
    "UnitPrice":"100.00",
    "ItemAmount":"80.00",
    "ProductLabel":"Shirt",
	"Discount": "20.00",
	"DiscountReason": "20% OFF SALE"
  },
  {
    "ItemID":1,
	"ParentItemID": 0,
    "ProductCode":"XXVH777",
    "UnitOfMeasure":"Other",
    "Quantity":"1",
	"UnitPrice":"0",
    "ItemAmount":"-10.00",
    "ProductLabel":"$10 voucher",
	"Discount": "10.00",
	"DiscountReason": "$10 voucher"	
  }
]
```

Discounts applied to the basket should be reflected by the `SaleItem` array based on how the Sale System handles discounts: 

* For discounts applied across the basket or to an individual item:
  * Set `UnitPrice` to the original item price
  * Update `ItemAmount` to reflect the discounted amount
  * Set `Discount` to reflect the discounted amount per item 
  * Set `DiscountReason` to the reason the item was discounted
* For a discount or voucher applied as a sale item:
  * Set `UnitPrice` to `0`
  * Include a `SaleItem` with a negative `ItemAmount` 
  * Set `Discount` to the discount value 
  * Set `DiscountReason` to the reason for the discount
  
### Refunds 

If the sale items are known for a refund, they should be represented in the `SaleItem` array, otherwise the `SaleItem` array can be left empty.

For example, if a customer purchases three pairs of shoes, and returns one pair:

* If the Sale System records the returned item, it should include that item in the `SaleItem` array with the refund 
* If the Sale System does not record the returned item, but is able to match to the original purchase, it should populate the `SaleItem` array with the items from the orignial purchase. 
* If the Sale System does not record the return item, and is unable to match to the original purchase, the `SaleItem` array can be left empty
  
Refund `SaleItem` objects are represented the same as purchase `SaleItem` objects.

For example:

* The fields marked as mandatory are still mandatory  
* Each `ItemAmount` is a positive amount which reflects the amount being refunded
* The `Quantity` reflects the number of the sale item being refunded

## SaleChannel

Commercial or distribution channel of the item. Default = "Unknown"

## SaleReferenceID

Mandatory for pre-authorisation and completion, otherwise optional.

A globally unique value, used to link a related series of transactions. 

For example, a pre-authorisation, followed by a pre-authorisation top-up, and then a completion all require the same `SaleReferenceID` in the request.

The Sale System must ensure the `SaleReferenceID` is unique across all [SaleID](#data-dictionary-saleid)'s and [POIID](#data-dictionary-poiid)'s across the merchant. If Sale Systems are not synchronised, it is recommended that this value should be a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) to ensure uniqueness.


## SaleTransactionID

Identification of a transaction for a given [SaleId](#data-dictionary-saleid). 

Contains the following fields: 

Attribute |Requ.| Format | Description |
-----------------                        |----| ------ | ----------- |
[TransactionID](#data-dictionary-transactionid)            | âœ” | String | Unique reference for this sale ticket. Not necessarily unique per payment request; for example a sale with split payments will have a number of payments with the same [TransactionID](#data-dictionary-transactionid)
[TimeStamp](#data-dictionary-timestamp)                    | âœ” | String | Time of initiating the payment request on the POI System, formatted as [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) DateTime. e.g. "2019-09-02T09:13:51.0+01:00"   



## ShiftNumber

An optional value sent in the [Login Request](#cloud-api-reference-methods-login) for information only. Used to identify the shift that drives the Sale Terminal during the session.

If present, totals in the [ReconciliationResponse](#cloud-api-reference-methods-reconciliation) will be grouped by this value. If not present, payment transactions that do not specify a `ShiftNumber` will not be grouped under a `ShiftNumber`.

Note that different shifts may still occur during the same login session by setting a `ShiftNumber` per payment. 


## ServiceID

The `ServiceID` is a text string between 1 and 10 characters long, which must uniquely identify a transaction between a Sale System and a POI Terminal over a short time period (e.g. one day). 

The `ServiceID` of the message response is mirrored from the `ServiceID` in the message request. This allows for duplicate message checks. 

The POI System will validate that the `ServiceID` is different from the previous request. The Sale System should validate that the `ServiceID` in the response matches the `ServiceID` sent in the request.

The `ServiceID` is used to identify a transaction to retrieve in a [transaction status](#cloud-api-reference-methods-transaction-status) request. 

## SoftwareVersion

The software version of the Sale System.

Must be the software version of the current Sale System build. 

## SplitPaymentFlag

Indicates if a payment is a split payment. Default to false. 

## TaxCode

Type of tax associated with the item. Default = "GST"


## TotalsGroupId

Groups transactions in a login session. 

This can be used for reconciliation purposes and may span a single day or different periods.

If not present, payment transactions will remain ungrouped. 

## TransactionType

Type of transaction for which totals are grouped.


Label                | Description       
-------------------- | ----------------- 
Debit                | Payment Debit transactions (e.g. if `PaymentType` is "Normal")

CashAdvance          | Cash-out payment types or cash components of a Normal payment type
ReverseDebit         | Payment Reversal Debit transactions
ReverseCredit        | Payment Reversal Credit transactions

Failed               | Transactions which have not successfully completed (`Result` = "Failure" and `ErrorCondition` not equal to "Refusal").



## TerminalEnvironment

Available values:

* **Attended** - a cashier interface is present
* **SemiAttended** - a cashier is present but not interfaced
* **Unattended** - no cashier is present


## TimeStamp

Date and time of a transaction for the Sale System, the POI System or the Acquirer. 

Formatted as [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). e.g. "2019-09-02T09:13:51.0+01:00"

Used to ensure the uniqueness of a transaction for Sale System, the POI System or the Acquirer, or indicates the time when the event occurs in the `EventNotification` message.
 

## TokenRequestedType

The `TokenRequestedType` is an optional field per transaction. Indicates if a token should be created for this sale, and if so which type of token. 

* If not present no token is created
* If set to "Transaction" a token is created which is only valid for the transaction. For example to process a subsequent Refund or Void/Reversal.
* If set to "Customer" a token is created which represents the PAN, and can be used to represent the card holder for a longer period.

:::caution
If a `Payment` is requested using a PaymentToken of the same TokenRequestedType and this JSON element is present, the existing Token is replaced. This can affect other Sale Terminals, so use with caution.
